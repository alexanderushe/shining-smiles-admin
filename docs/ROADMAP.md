# Shining Smiles Admin System — Phase 2 Roadmap
### Core Features, Architecture Decisions & Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the Phase 2 strategy for the Shining Smiles Admin System, following completion of backend API development, API validation, and frontend API integration.

---

# ✅ Phase 1 Summary (Completed)
- Backend API development (Students, Payments, Reports, Notifications)
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Frontend integration with Next.js
- Offline queue for payments (+ sync mechanism)
- End-to-end testing with Postman + browser console
- Dockerized backend + PostgreSQL database

The foundation is now stable. We are ready to build workflows, features, and real-world usability.

---

# 🚀 Phase 2 Goals  
Transform the functional API + UI into a complete school administration platform with authentication, permissions, financial workflows, offline resilience, and UX polish.

---

# 🧩 Phase 2 — Major Feature Pillars

## 1. Authentication & Role-Based Access Control
### Why
Secure system access and restrict features by staff roles.

### Features
- Login page (username/password)
- Token-based authentication (DRF token or JWT)
- Role assignment:
  - Admin
  - Cashier
  - Headmaster
  - Bursar
  - Viewer (read-only)
- Route protection on frontend
- Hide/show pages based on role
- Auto-redirect unauthorized users

### Backend
- `/api/v1/auth/login/`
- `/api/v1/auth/logout/`
- `/api/v1/auth/user/`
- Role injected in token response

### Frontend
- Store token in `localStorage`
- Protect routes using higher-order Auth component

---

## 2. Students Module — Complete UI Workflow
### Screens
- Students Index
- Student Profile
- Add/Edit/Delete Student
- Search & Filter (by grade, campus)
- Upload profile picture (optional)
- PDF/CSV export

### Backend Enhancements
- Filtering params
- Bulk update endpoints
- Optional document uploads

### Frontend Features
- Modern UI table (pagination, search)
- Student payment history chart
- “Outstanding Balance” calculation

---

## 3. Payments Module — Full Cashier Workflow
### Screens
- Payments List
- Add Payment Form
- Payment Detail
- Offline Mode
- Sync Status Indicator

### Logic
- Full validation (student exists, fee type valid)
- Prevent duplicates
- Auto-calculate balance after payment
- PDF receipt generation

### Offline Strategy
- Detect offline status
- Queue form submissions
- Auto-sync on reconnect
- UI notification on successful sync

---

## 4. Reports & Analytics Module
### Financial Reports
- Daily Summary
- Term Fees Collection Report
- Cashier Activity Report
- Campus-Level Summary
- Student Balance Sheet

### Export Options
- PDF
- CSV
- Email report to admin

### Visual Analytics (Phase 3)
- Charts (line, bar, donut)
- Comparative analysis per campus

---

## 5. Notifications System
### uses `/api/v1/notifications/`

### Features
- System alerts (payment posted, sync complete, offline mode)
- Toast notifications
- In-app Notifications Center
- Mark-as-read

### Auto-Events
- Payment posted → Send notification
- Daily backup → Notification
- Failed sync → Warning

---

## 6. Data Sync & Offline Framework
### Goals
System must work even with poor network.

### Components
- Sync queue manager
- Conflict detection (duplicate payments)
- Retry schedule (exponential)
- Visual indicators:
  - “Offline mode”
  - “Sync pending”
  - “Sync failed”

---

## 7. UI/UX Polishing
### Improvements
- Sidebar navigation redesign
- Better typography and spacing
- Skeleton loaders
- Error boundaries (friendly error UI)
- Mobile optimization
- Dark mode (optional)

---

## 8. Deployment Pipeline
### Backend
- Docker container
- Gunicorn + Nginx
- HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt
- Production Postgres DB on server/cloud

### Frontend
- Next.js optimized build
- Deploy on:
  - Vercel
  - Docker container with Nginx
- Environment variables managed via `.env.production`

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions pipeline
  - Build
  - Lint
  - Test
  - Deploy

---

## 9. QA Testing & Debugging
### Tools
- Cypress (E2E tests)
- Jest/React Testing Library (frontend components)
- DRF API tests (backend)
- Load testing with Locust

### Critical Flows to Test
- Login
- Posting payments (online + offline)
- PDF generation
- Reports accuracy
- Sync failures

---

## 10. Documentation & Training
### Outputs
- System User Manual
- Cashier Payment Workflow Guide
- Admin Configuration Guide
- Developer API Handbook
- Data dictionary (Student → Payments → Reports)

### Optional
- Training videos (2–5 min each)

# 🧭 Project Management (Phased Timeline)
| Phase | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Phase 2.1 | Auth + RBAC | 3–4 days |
| Phase 2.2 | Students UI + workflows | 4–6 days |
| Phase 2.3 | Payments workflows + offline | 4–6 days |
| Phase 2.4 | Reports + export | 3–5 days |
| Phase 2.5 | Notifications + UX polish | 2–4 days |
| Phase 2.6 | Deployment + CI/CD | 3–5 days |
| Phase 2.7 | QA + system testing | 3–7 days |

---

# ✔️ Final Recommendation
Proceed **immediately** to:

## **Phase 2.1 — Authentication + Role-Based Access**
This unlocks every other workflow.

Once Auth is done → we move into the Students and Payments workflow screens.
