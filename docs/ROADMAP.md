# Shining Smiles Admin System — Phase 2 Roadmap
### Core Features, Architecture Decisions & Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the Phase 2 strategy for the Shining Smiles Admin System, following completion of backend API development, API validation, and frontend API integration.

---

# ✅ Phase 1 Summary (Completed)
- Backend API development (Students, Payments, Reports, Notifications)
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Frontend integration with Next.js
- Offline queue for payments (+ sync mechanism)
- End-to-end testing with Postman + browser console
- Dockerized backend + PostgreSQL database

The foundation is now stable. We are ready to build workflows, features, and real-world usability.

# 🏗️ Phase 1.5 — Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture (CRITICAL FOUNDATION)

### Why This Comes First
The current system is **single-tenant** - it can only serve one school. To build a scalable SaaS business serving multiple schools from one deployment, we need multi-tenant architecture **before** building additional features.

**Business Case:**
- Revenue potential: $50K-150K/year within 24 months
- Target: 500-800 private schools in Zimbabwe
- Pricing: $60-$350/month per school (tiered by size)
- Economics: 95%+ profit margins at scale

**Without multi-tenancy:** Each new school requires manual code changes and separate deployment.
**With multi-tenancy:** Schools self-register and are instantly operational.

---

## Phase 1.5 Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Full Multi-Tenant (Recommended for Long-term)
Complete multi-tenant implementation including school registration UI.

**Deliverables:**
- School model with subscription tracking
- All models updated with school foreign keys
- Tenant isolation middleware
- School registration API + UI
- WhatsApp bot multi-school routing
- Data migration for existing school

**Timeline:** 7-10 days

---

### Option B: Lazy Multi-Tenant (Recommended for MVP)
Database foundation now, registration UI later.

**Phase 1.5a (This Week):**
- Create School model
- Add school foreign keys to all models (Student, Payment, Campus, etc.)
- Update all queries to filter by school
- Migration script for existing data → "Shining Smiles" school
- Update WhatsApp bot queries for school context

**Phase 1.5b (When Needed):**
- Build school registration API + UI
- School settings/branding page
- Multi-school onboarding workflow

**Timeline:** 5-7 days (Phase 1.5a only)

---

## Database Schema Changes

### New Model: School
```python
class School(models.Model):
    name = CharField(max_length=255)
    code = CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    email = EmailField()
    phone = CharField(max_length=20)
    address = TextField()
    
    # Subscription
    is_active = BooleanField(default=True)
    subscription_tier = CharField(max_length=50)  # starter/growth/professional/enterprise
    monthly_fee = DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    
    # WhatsApp config
    whatsapp_phone_number = CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)
    whatsapp_enabled = BooleanField(default=True)
```

### Updated Models (Add `school` ForeignKey)
- Student
- Payment
- Campus
- Profile (User)
- Statement
- Reconciliation
- Notification

### Updated Constraints
Change from globally unique to school-scoped unique:
- Student number: unique per school
- Campus code: unique per school
- Receipt number: unique per school + term + year

---

## Multi-Tenant Isolation Strategy

### Backend
1. **Middleware:** Set current school context from logged-in user
2. **QuerySet filtering:** All queries automatically filter by school
3. **Permissions:** Users can only access their school's data
4. **API validation:** Enforce school boundaries on create/update

### WhatsApp Bot
**Strategy:** Phone number → School mapping
- Look up student by parent phone number
- Identify associated school
- Filter all queries by that school
- Handle unregistered numbers gracefully

### Frontend
- Store school_id in user token/session
- All API calls scoped to user's school
- (Optional) Super-admin can switch between schools

---

## Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Students | Price/Month | Target Schools |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Starter** | < 150 | $60 | Small schools |
| **Growth** | 150-400 | $120 | Medium schools |
| **Professional** | 400-800 | $200 | Large schools |
| **Enterprise** | 800+ | $350 | Very large schools |

**Fair Use Limits:**
- 500 WhatsApp messages/month included
- Overages: $0.01 per additional message
- 10GB storage per school

---

## Testing & Validation

### Automated Tests
- Data isolation between schools
- School-scoped queries
- Permission boundaries
- WhatsApp routing accuracy

### Manual Validation
1. Create 2 test schools
2. Add data to each
3. Verify complete isolation
4. Test user switching
5. Test WhatsApp bot with multiple schools

---

## Migration Path for Existing Data

```bash
# Migration script (to be created)
python manage.py migrate_to_multitenant \
  --school-name "Shining Smiles" \
  --school-code "SS001" \
  --whatsapp "+263..."
```

All existing students, payments, users → assigned to default school.

---

## Success Metrics

**Technical:**
- ✅ 100% data isolation (no cross-school data leaks)
- ✅ All tests passing with multi-tenant context
- ✅ < 50ms query overhead from school filtering

**Business:**
- ✅ School can register in < 10 minutes
- ✅ Zero code changes to onboard new school
- ✅ Infrastructure costs scale sub-linearly

---

# 🚀 Phase 2 Goals  
Transform the functional API + UI into a complete school administration platform with authentication, permissions, financial workflows, offline resilience, and UX polish.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** All Phase 2 features will be built on the multi-tenant foundation from Phase 1.5, ensuring every feature is scalable from day one.

# 🧭 Project Management (Phased Timeline)

| Phase | Description | Duration | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Phase 1.5** | **Multi-Tenant SaaS Foundation** | **5–7 days** | **🔴 CRITICAL** |
| Phase 2.1 | Auth + RBAC | 3–4 days | High |
| Phase 2.2 | Students UI + workflows | 4–6 days | High |
| Phase 2.3 | Payments workflows + offline | 4–6 days | High |
| Phase 2.4 | Reports + export | 3–5 days | Medium |
| Phase 2.5 | Notifications + UX polish | 2–4 days | Medium |
| Phase 2.6 | Deployment + CI/CD | 3–5 days | High |
| Phase 2.7 | QA + system testing | 3–7 days | High |

**Total Estimated Timeline:** 26-48 days (including multi-tenant foundation)

**⚠️ CRITICAL PATH:** Phase 1.5 must complete before Phase 2 features to ensure all new features are built multi-tenant from day one.

# ✔️ Final Recommendation

## **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Phase 1.5 — Multi-Tenant SaaS Foundation**

**Start with "Lazy Multi-Tenant" (Phase 1.5a):**

This week, implement the database foundation:
1. Create `School` model
2. Add `school` foreign keys to all existing models
3. Update all queries to filter by school
4. Migrate existing data to default "Shining Smiles" school
5. Update WhatsApp bot queries for school context

**Why this first:**
- ✅ Every feature you build after this is scalable
- ✅ No future refactoring needed
- ✅ Can onboard School #2 whenever ready
- ✅ Only 5-7 days of focused work
- ✅ Unlocks $50K-150K/year revenue potential

**After Phase 1.5a completes** → proceed to Phase 2.1 (Authentication + RBAC)
